# 🚀 Kawach

Kawach is a MERN stack app designed to provide secure and private document sharing, ensuring that your sensitive data remains safe from misuse.

The Problem:  
Imagine you’re a customer who needs to share a document — let’s say a contract or personal identification — with a cafe owner or any other business for a service, such as printing. In a typical scenario, the cafe owner might save your document on their computer or device. Over time, this could lead to risks such as your private information being misused, sold, or shared without your consent.  

For example, when you hand over your document for printing, there’s a chance it could be stored on their system indefinitely. If the document isn’t deleted properly after the service, it might get copied, shared, or even resold without your knowledge. Worse still, if it ends up in the hands of a third party, you might never know where your sensitive data has gone or how it’s being used.  

This creates a significant risk to your privacy and data security in what should be a simple transaction.
